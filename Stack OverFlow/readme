# Stack Overflow

A stack overflow occurs when a program writes more data to the stack than it can hold. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, and vulnerabilities.

## Stack Overflow and DDoS

Stack overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, which can be used to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In a DDoS attack, multiple compromised systems are used to target a single system, causing a denial of service for users of the targeted system.

## Mitigations

To prevent stack overflow vulnerabilities, consider the following best practices:

1. **Limit Stack Size**: Avoid allocating large amounts of data on the stack to prevent overflow.
2. **Use Heap Memory**: Allocate memory on the heap instead of the stack for large data structures.
3. **Bounds Checking**: Validate input and ensure that data written to the stack does not exceed its capacity.
4. **Stack Canaries**: Use stack canaries to detect stack buffer overflows and prevent exploitation.
5. **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**: Enable ASLR to randomize the memory layout and make it harder for attackers to exploit stack overflow vulnerabilities.
