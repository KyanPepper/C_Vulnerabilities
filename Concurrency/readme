# Concurrency Vulnerabilities

Concurrency vulnerabilities occur when multiple threads or processes access shared resources simultaneously, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security risks. These vulnerabilities can manifest in various ways, including:

1. **Race Conditions**: When two or more threads attempt to modify shared data at the same time, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results. For example, if two threads try to increment a counter simultaneously, the final value may be incorrect.

2. **Deadlocks**: When two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, causing all of them to be stuck indefinitely. This can happen if threads acquire locks in different orders.

3. **Livelocks**: Similar to deadlocks, but instead of being stuck, the threads keep changing their state in response to each other without making any progress.

4. **Resource Starvation**: When a thread is perpetually denied access to resources it needs to proceed, often because other threads are monopolizing those resources.

5. **Atomicity Violations**: When a sequence of operations that should be executed atomically (as a single, indivisible operation) is interrupted, leading to inconsistent states.



## Mitigations

To prevent concurrency vulnerabilities, consider the following best practices:

1. **Synchronization**: Use synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables to coordinate access to shared resources.

2. **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic operations or transactions to ensure that critical sections of code are executed atomically.

3. **Thread Safety**: Design data structures and algorithms to be thread-safe, ensuring that they can be accessed and modified by multiple threads without conflicts.

4. **Avoid Global Variables**: Minimize the use of global variables, as they can be accessed by multiple threads without proper synchronization.
