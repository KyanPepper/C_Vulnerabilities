**Description:**  
> This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it.  

##Write-up

> Just running the program provides us a little bit of a hint.

# ./narnia5
Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
buffer : [] (0)
i = 1 (0xffb60dbc)

> Looks like we have to read 5 times before we get back to our input.  They are already giving us the location of ```i``` as ```0xffffd4ec```, so we should be able to move directly into trying to overwrite the value.  To do this we'll use the ```%n``` format as it ```writes the number of bytes written so far```.  We can specify the address to change by inserting it at the begining of our input and using ```%x``` to get back to it.  Then all we need to do is insert the correct number of bytes and we should be able to overwrite ```i``` with the value ```500```.
