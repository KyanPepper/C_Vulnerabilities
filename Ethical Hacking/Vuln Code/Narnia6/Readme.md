**Description:**  
> This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it.

> So this looks a little more complex than the previous challenges.  I'm not the best with ```C```, so let's start from the top.  The first bit that I don't quite get is the ```int  (*fp)(char *)=(int(*)(char *))&puts, i;```.  Let's see what's going on here.  After a little googling I was able to get a little information on this line.  Basically we can read this as two separate declarations.  The first is a function pointer ```(*fp)``` to the function ```puts``` and the second is just for an integer ```i```.  That function pointer sounds interesting and really dangerous.  If we can change the pointer to point to something better than ```puts```, then when ```fp(b1)``` is called it will pass our user input to that other function.  I don't see any reference to ```/bin/sh``` in the code like some of the previous challenges so we'll have to find another way to spawn a shell. Let's just poke around a little bit and see if we can find anything.

> Wow. It worked. We can see the address overwritten ```0xffffd4e8``` with ```0x080483d0``` and then when we continue execution we see the results of ```fp(b1)```, which is our first parameter being printed via ```printf```. Now we need to find something that we can spawn a shell with.  There doesn't appear to be anything helpful in the application itself, so let's start looking at what the libraries provide. The first library ```stdio.h```just basically has all of the functions necessary to read/write to various streams (files, stdin, stdout, ect).  We could potentially try to use one of those functions to read the ```/etc/narnia_pass/narnia7``` file, but it doesn't look like it would be an easy setup.  Moving to ```stdlib.h``` we have a few more interesting options.  This library seems like a grab bag.  There are functions for generating random numbers, functions for converting data types, but it also has functions for grabbing environment data and running OS commands.  The latter, ```system``` function, seems to fit the bill the best.  The only problem is I don't see an address for ```system``` like I did for ```printf```. After a quick [google search](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=gdb+break+on+library+function&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) it looks like something like ```(gdb) break system``` should work.  It never hurts to try and ```break system``` sounds like an awesome command anyway.

Maybe we need to play with that second parameter a bit, remember, in the begining it looked like we could overwrite what appeared to be a return with 20 characters.  Looking back, it was likely overwriting the function point address and just running through both buffers to do so.
